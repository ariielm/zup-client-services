[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP verbs

This application uses the RESTful concepts to respond each corresponding HTTP verb.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PUT`
| Used to update an existing resource, with the complete resource on payload

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===

This application also is compliant with the RESTful architecture.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available on the response's
`Location` header

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist
|===

[[overview-hypermedia]]
== Hypermedia

The Zup Client Services uses hypermedia in each response. Responses are in
http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application Language (HAL)] format.
Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. Users of the API should
not create URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described links to navigate
